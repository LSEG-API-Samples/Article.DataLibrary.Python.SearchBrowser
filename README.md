# Build queries easily using Refinitiv's Search API with Python and Jupyter


## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The *SearchBrowser* module is a convenient tool that greatly simplifies the challenges of discovering financial properties when programmatically building Search requests using Refinitiv's Search API.  The module is a simple class that is responsible for managing the manipulation of debug and metadata information.  The goal of this module is to hold financial properties, metadata, and data values, based on search criteria, that users can observe and interrogate at any time.

Details and concepts are further explained in the [Build queries easily using Refinitiv Search API with Python and Jupyter](https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/build-expressions-with-refinitiv-search-python-jupyter-notebook) article published on the [Refinitiv Developer Community portal](https://developers.refinitiv.com).

## <a id="disclaimer"></a>Disclaimer
The source code presented in this project has been written by Refinitiv only for the purpose of illustrating the concepts of interrogating the Search service using the *Refinitiv Data Library for Python*.
